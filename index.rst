Welcome to the Electron Cash documentation!
===========================================

**SECURITY ALERT: Electron Cash version 3.1.2 has been released. A JSONRPC security hole was discovered that affects all Electrum forks. This has been fully patched in Electron Cash 3.1.2. If you were running a prior version as an online wallet without a strong password, you should consider the wallet compromised and create a fresh wallet with version 3.1.2 or better. **

Electron Cash is a lightweight Bitcoin Cash wallet.

Electron Cash can be downloaded from https://electroncash.org/. This is the *only* authentic source.
